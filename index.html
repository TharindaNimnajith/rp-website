            Since English has become the most widely used language in the world, most people are involved in learning
            English daily as beginners. With the increasing demand, more research has been conducted on learning
            English language in the e-learning domain recently with little success.
            With the advancement of computer power and multimedia applications, there has been a new interest in
            Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Teaching (CAPT) applications in recent years. Pronunciation errors could
            be classified into two main types called phonemic and prosodic errors. Those errors have different
            features. By extracting those features, software can measure the pronunciation level of a speaker in
            different ways. Much research is done on pronunciation error detection using these features in various
            ways. The likelihood-based scoring feature initially used in the 1990s saw the creation of several
            likelihood-based phoneme-level error detection algorithms. For example, Yoon Kim, Horacio Franco, and
            Leonardo Neumeyer used log-likelihood scores in forced alignment mode. Expanded versions of
            likelihood-based scores were also successfully used by Brian Mak et al. Prosodic pronunciation error
            detection and feedback are very detailed discussions of CAPT systems. Jared Bernstein, Jian Cheng, and
            Masanori Suzuki have shown that there appears to be a linear relationship between fluency measures and
            human judgments of proficiency. Pieter Mueller, Febe de Wet, Christa van der Walt, and Thomas Niesler
            applied phoneme-level log-likelihood scoring to speech from near-native language learners. It was found
            that the GOP score did not correlate with human ratings. Based on the existing research, there are
            challenges that need to be overcome to be able to develop a truly useful pronunciation teaching
            application.
            In the past few years, the e-learning industry grew rapidly. However, current e-learning industry is
            mainly focused on the content delivered to students. Furthermore, they deliver the same content to every
            user, whereas, users are different from each other in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. Much
            research addresses this one-size-fits-all issue. For example, Schiaffino, Garcia, and Amandi proposed an
            intelligent agent-eTeacher by victimization Bayesian network technique which provides personalized
            assistance to e-learning students by observing the behavior of the student while he or she is taking
            online courses and automatically building the student’s profile. Halawa, Hamed, and Shehab proposed a
            personalized e-learning recommendation model based on the psychological type and learning style model
            focused on student personality types and the dominant preferences based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
            (MBTI) theory. Yanni and Ping, the authors of a study on personality learning in e-learning systems have
            implemented a recommendation engine based on trust value. The intelligent recommendation engine with user
            interest would help to introduce customized user attraction with the method, according to the
            above-mentioned values. However, only a limited number of research focuses on user flaws and feedback to
            incorporate a customized course content recommendation engine.
            Automated essay evaluation is a trending topic at present research. The beginning of automated essay
            evaluation was found in the works of Page in 1960s. In 1966, Page has proposed Project Essay Grader (PEG)
            which is a system developed to make the essay evaluation process more practical. PEG system identifies a
            group of text features and proxies, that are considered approximations of the intrinsic variables of
            writing quality. However, it is only relying on linguistic features where neither NLP nor lexical content
            is considered [20, 21]. Intelligent Essay Assessor (IEA) has been developed in the late 1990s, for
            automated essay evaluation, using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Furthermore, Mahana, Johns, and Apte of
            Stanford University suggested a solution for automated essay grading with linear regression techniques
            which evaluated the essays based on different parameters such as dexterity, diction, vocabulary,
            structure, and organization. Even though there are several pieces of research done on automated essay
            grading, they consist of many limitations such as lower accuracy, dismissing grammatical and spelling
            mistakes, and lack of proper feedback.
            The semantic textual similarity is a heavily discussed topic in computational linguistics due to the
            advancements of AI-based technologies and its heavy usage in multiple domains including the automatic
            short descriptive answer evaluation process. The difficulty of measuring up to how much the contextual
            meaning of a text is reflected in another text and the difficulty of accurately computing the semantic
            textual similarity between two texts are proven in many previously conducted computational linguistics
            research. Similar study has been conducted on evaluating the paraphrasing of explanation of a graph by
            Senevirathne, Fernando, White, Divyanjala, Udara Samaratunge, and Dias, where a smart personal intelligent
            assistant is built for IELTS examination candidates. The above study evaluated the similarity of the
            sentences using the cosine proximity technique, and Doc2Vec model. The limitation of the sentence
            similarity module of this system is its low accuracy of 67 percent. Many approaches with BLEU, n-grams,
            and WordNet based on NLP-based techniques have many shortcomings and limitations such as lower accuracy
            due to measuring syntactic similarity instead of semantic similarity. Further, in the past few years,
            there has also been an uptake of expressing ontologies using semantic web languages such as the Web
            Ontology Language (OWL) for semantic textual similarity evaluation. In conclusion, the majority of
            research has been conducted by measuring text similarity using various traditional NLP-based methodologies
            and algorithms for keyword matching. Most of these methods provide less accurate results as they measure
            the number of matching keywords present in each text and the syntactic similarity, rather than the
            semantic similarity. Due to the high complexities of linguistics in the English language in general, it is
            not possible to claim the two texts are similar in meaning just by matching keywords, without trying to
            understand the overall meaning and semantics of the text. But the state of the art methodologies using
            deep learning and neural networks try to compare two texts based on their overall meaning and provide a
            more reliable and accurate similarity evaluation.
            In conclusion, most of these previous research and existing systems have major shortcomings and
            limitations. Thus, to overcome the above-given limitations the proposed system includes several novel
            features.

            Most Sri Lankans struggle with English examinations to reach expected grades that are required for their
            educational and career goals. The English Language literacy in Sri Lanka is just 22% among Sri Lanka’s
            population above 15 years of age [1].
            There are no recommendation systems for English Language learning applications in Sri Lanka that recommend
            lessons and activities based on the weaknesses of the particular user in a personalized way [2].
            Existing solutions do not provide accurate automatic evaluations for speaking and writing activities with
            subjective answers such as essays and summarizations based on different criteria focused on grading
            standards used in globally recognized English language examinations [3].
