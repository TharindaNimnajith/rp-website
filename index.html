						In year 2018 Mohit M.Kanfade, Sukriya D.Ambade, Amol P Bhagat published a 
						research paper called “Location Based Notification System” [1]. 
						They have proposed a system for an android mobile application which can serve location based services. 
						According to their research the proposed system was consist of functionalities for location reminder and 
						friendly suggestions and system registered shops’ offer notifications. And also there is a admin panel. 
						By using that admin can log into the system and can add and delete shops. shop manager is able to add offers 
						on a panel. can  As the methodology of their research they have used GPS and LBS to track users. They havent mention the 
						way that their published the offers to their mobile application. In future they will going to improve the system. As the future 
						improvements they will include following applications in their mobile application: vehicle tracking system , billing system , weather forecasting , 
						use of e-card through mobile no , Tracking the user path , Emergency services , and automatic toll/parking.    
						<br><br>
						In year 2018 Wei Jie Phua , Malcolm Yoke Hean Low , Neelakantam venkatarayalu and jared Koh published a research paper 
						called “[2]”. They proposed efficient patient discharge workflow to hospitals. In typical hospital environment patient 
						discharge process is time consuming. Because of that this leads to long waiting time for patients and also their will be a queue 
						to assign patients to a bed. They did a research to solve that problem. They tried to minimize turnaround time upon discharge of a patient.
						They proposed NFC based system to achieve their goal.They developed Android-based mobile application. This mobile application is used for both 
						nurses and housekeepers. One of the key functionality of the mobile application is send notifications. Notification service is automated. To send 
						notifications they used Telegram Bot API. When the patient leaves the hospital notification will send to housekeepers through the system. That notification 
						include cleaning request and viewing of bed status. And also after cleaning of the bed it informs admissions office. According to this system instead of 
						using discharge slip use NFC tags. Nurse assign the NFC tag to discharging patient. Instead of using deposit basket at the nurse counter uses NFC card reader 
						to read NFC tags which are assigned to the discharge patients. Mainly they used NFC tag reader and it is connected to the Raspberry Pi and internet access is 
						needed. That system needs low cost and can be easily deployed.
						<br><br>
						In year 2017 Prasanta Saikia and James she published a research paper on “Effective mobile notification Recommendation using Social 
						nature of Locations” [3].  They proposed a mobile notification recommendation system which is location based service. They proposed a news 
						recommendation method. It collects user preferences for different news categories at different locations. They group locations by analyzing 
						two location grouping methods such as manual and other is based on similarities. They identified types of a location using GPS geolocation data.  
						They mention as their future works determining the optimal number of localities without having to evaluate the optimization model for each location 
						grouping method would be studied.
						<br>
						<br>
						In year 2015 Takaaki Tsunoda proposed a novel task for utilizing  review analysis to suggest product advertisement improvements [4]. They use the review analysis technique. By using review analysis technique they determine which aspects can be included in a blurb of the product.  show aspect candidates that could be incorporated into the blurb ordered by their importance to users for a given product is the goal of their task. As the review analysis technique they break their task into two sub tasks. aspect grouping and aspect group ranking. They assigning aspect expressions to aspect groups to manage aspects at the semantic level.  They next score aspect groups to suggest only important aspect groups. For the aspect grouping they used one of the semi-supervised learnig methods. Those methods are  described by zhai et al in year 2010. For the aspect group ranking they used aspect ranking method. That method proposed by lnui et al in year 2013.
						<br><br>
						In year 2018 Y.Gopi , Varikallu Sumalatha published a research about Tele comm. Customer data analysis using Multi-Layer clustering model [5]. They are main goal is to verify the high homogeneity of individual clusters, and also the high degree of unsimilarity among individuals, given the appropriate segments. They are first collecting and segmenting individual customer’s contributions , personal preferences, overall customer profile and other factors.  They used data mining technology and two layer clustering model in their research. Marketers can use pre-analysis and data mining to target their customers and also marketers can  sell the company’s products and services with accurate marketing. As they use two layer clustering model there are two layers. The first layer examines customer value. And the second layer uses customer behaviour features. The second layer is used for further grouping. The two layer customer model that they are proposed provides a macro and micro perspective to assist mobile CRM.  
						<br><br>
						In year 2015 can yang , zhiye chen , Tianyi wang and pengfei sun published a research on sentiment analysis of customer reviews based on the ontology of phone [6].  They developed FOBPRM (Feature Ontology Based Product Review Miner) system. They extract and summarize customer reviews on products.  This process is ontology based. The proposed system has three parts. Firstly all the data containing reviews must be pre-processing. Then after use lexicon to enrich the computing term special degree and similarity to construct an ontology tree. Next method of information entropy used. That is used to select high correlation feature-sentiment pairs and compute their polarity. That is compute by using frequency. Finally summary will be an output. This summary contain feature and sentiment.
						<br><br>
						In year 2011 Abhijit Raorane & R.V. Kulkarni published a research on “Data mining Techniques : A Source for consumer Behaviour Analysis” [7].  Their main objective is to know consumer behaviour. They study why person wants to buy a certain product at the time of he purchasing a product.  They use data mining as a technology to analyze consumer’s behaviour. First they choosing an organization to test and do their experiments. After they collect data from different organizations they searches various methodologies and algorithms to analyze consumer’s behaviour. Then after they decided to use association rule for checking association between the several products which are brought by the consumer’s.        
						<br><br>
						The patent on “System and method for providing recommendation of goods or services based on recorded purchasing history”[8] is developed on how to goods and service are recommended utilizing distributed network for potential customers selection based on past purchase history.They provide recommendation of goods and services according to customer interest based on customer profile and personal information such as age,profession, gender,etc… when creating user profile.This invention allows customer a distributed network to obtain recommendations  of goods and services that may be interest of user by reducing the inputs from user compared to prior systems.Instead of relying in personal information by user for recommendations this system user history database to determine the recommendation.
						<br><br>
						In this paper(“Mobile Advertising : Does Location-Based Advertising Work?”)[9] we examine consumer reactions to different advertising strategies (Location based versus location independent) advertising using the mobile phone as new platform to omit the barriers between user and business offerings by getting closer to particular shop.Even Though such advertising is convincing it also can be identified as unwanted.This paper examines effectiveness of such through an experiment which manipulate the locations.These finding are discussed in form of how,when and where to advertise using mobile phone. We explore the conflict between convenience and intrusiveness which may create a dilemma about how to react. We examine the moderating impact of location type and contextual type.
						<br><br>
						We report an experimental study to decide these location based advertising influence the effectiveness of these strategies in getting user response to the promotional offer. The responses are discussed as effects of such advertising strategies usefulness.

						In 2008 Ankur Gupta and Rajni Jindal conducted a study regarding ranking algorithms in search engines [10]. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of different work done in this field. In this study, they have identified the need for ranking algorithms and they have presented a survey conducted on major ranking algorithms used in search engines. In this paper, mainly their focus was to explore how search engines prioritize results relevant to the user when using different algorithms. PageRank, Hubs and Authorities, Hilltop, Query sensitive page ranking are few of the algorithms they have touched upon. Also, they have provided an overview of algorithms that have built by modifying the PageRank algorithm which is used by the Google search engine. In this study, they have identified in terms of speed and memory requirements PageRank algorithms is the most efficient. Also, they have identified that when using personalized ranking algorithms there is a trade-off between efficiency and making results more relative to user preferences.
						<br><br>
						In 2006 Eugene Agichtein, Eric Brill and Susan Dumais published a conference paper on “Improving web search ranking by incorporating user behaviour information” [11]. In this article, they have shown how Implicit feedback (User actions when interacting with the search engine) affect the ordering of the search results. They have used 2 approaches when cooperating user behaviour into ranking algorithm. First, they studied the ranking when implicit feedback is used separately. Then implicit feedback integrated with the ranking algorithm. They have used a model called “implicit user feedback model” to obtain noisy user interaction from a web search engine as vector features to use with the ranking algorithm. For this study, they have used over 12 million user interactions. In conclusion, they have shown that there was a 31% improvement in the final ranking when user behaviour is considered.
						<br><br>
						“Personalized Search Based on User Search Histories” conference paper is authored by Mirco Speretta and Susan Gauch [12]. They have studied how user data such as user profile and user interests can be used to improve personalized search results. Furthermore, they have examined different ways to gather user data. As a result, they have implemented a wrapper called GoogleWrapper. Which can implicitly create user profiles by using user search queries, search results and click data through a search engine. From this study, they were able to prove that the information that is readily available to search engines are sufficient for improve personalized searching and also the use of users’ data in search will improve the rankings.
